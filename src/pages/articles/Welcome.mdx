# Welcome to my Blog!

Hello Internet! I'm very pleased to start a new project: my very own blog!

## What do I plan to write about?

For now, I want to keep my scope pretty small so I don't overwhelm myself, therefore I'll mostly stick to topics related to my other current hobbies or projects

Even still, that's a lot of content I could talk about!

## How often are you going to post?

I plan to posting at least once a week, depending on how much I can get myself to write in that timeframe. I want to be able to write something that it worthy of its own blogpost, not something the size of a tweet!
Due to my busy schedule as a student, I will most likely only post on weekends.

This is only my introductory post, so I will keep it short. I hope to write to everyone soon!
