Every week we would have a new project that would teach us about a new field of engineering and how engineers in these fields solve problems. For one of the weeks, we learn about biomechanics by designing a hand extension out of cardboard, straws, string, and glue. From these simple elements, we were able to create a functional arm that could pick up ping pong balls and even a roll of tape! By using engineering concepts, my lab group and I were able to create something functional despite the material constraints. For the last four weeks of the lab, we had to create our own robot using any of the materials provided by the lab. This project gave us the freedom of making our own goal and designing for it, but also required us to use at least one moving component to incorporate robotics into our final design. My group and I decided to create a small RC car with a cardboard chassis, an Arduino to control the motors and sensors, and a joystick to accept human input. We were able to demo our final design during the lab's final robot show and receive a passing grade."

I was able to complete three of the four weeks, and along the way I learned more about 3d rendering, especially in Blender. For two of my three finished scenes, I used Blender's Eevee rendering engine, which prioritizes speed and style over realism. Instead of trying to make something that looked real, I tried to many something unique that was only possible with 3d rendering software. I ended up making a summer drink, a beach chair, and a sandcastle, each using different styles, textures, and rendering methods. From this project, I learned how to think outside the box when designing renders and use computer rendering software in a way that no other medium can."

Through our platform, you can access any development environment, create a new project in any programming language, and run it hassle-free on the cloud, all without leaving your browser window. We initially started CodeNest to gain experience working on a large project as a group. Eventually, CodeNest became a proof-of-concept, an idea that we could keep building into a reality. Our goal is that CodeNest becomes a gateway to new programmers, making coding more accessible to the world."

Currently, we are using Auth0 to handle user login and signup, and they already create a default avatar using Gravatar, but I found it to be too boring, just the user's initials and a background color ðŸ˜´. So, I decided to make my own version, and add a username generator on top.

My objective for this project was to create a username and avatar generator that generates a unique username and avatar for each new user, with no chance for duplicates, and creates a memorable and interesting output, not just random characters and a bland image."
