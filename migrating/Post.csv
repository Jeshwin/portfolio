"17","2023-08-03 21:58:54.645","2023-08-04 00:05:45.331","<h1>Why did I make my website?</h1><p>During the summer of 2021, I first learned about <a href=""https://nodejs.org/en"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Node.js</a>. My first experience with JavaScript was learning basic HTML in middle school, adding code between script tags to make the text change when the mouse hovered over it and little things like that. Node changed my whole paradigm with JavaScript, allowing me to run JavaScript directly on my computer or even a cloud server. At the same time, I was introduced to JavaScript frameworks that I could use to make my own website fully in JavaScript. Therefore, for my summer I decided to try and make my own responsive website using this technology that I had recently learned about.</p><p>My first trial at a website used <a href=""https://vuejs.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Vue.js</a>, a popular open source component framework, and <a href=""https://expressjs.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Express</a> for the back-end. While I was able to make a working website on my own computer, I ran into scaling issues trying to host my website, since it required two separate running instances of Node for the front and back ends. I had experimented with using <a href=""https://www.docker.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Docker</a> Compose for this, but I didn't have enough experience with hosting on the cloud to maintain my own server running Docker.</p><p>My next attempt the following summer had more success. Instead of using Vue, which lacked in developer support, I switched to using <a href=""https://react.dev/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">React</a>. the most popular JavaScript component framework created at Facebook. I was able to learn this entirely new framework relatively easily not only because of the greater access to resources on the Internet, but also because my previous experience with Vue gave me a more solid foundation with developing with JavaScript and Node. I wasn't able to host my website during that summer either, but this year that changed.</p><h1>How did I make my website?</h1><p>As I started my first year at Santa Clara University, I discovered a new hosting platform called <a href=""https://vercel.com/home"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Vercel</a>. Their solutions offered an intuitive interface for hosting and maintaining my own website. I couldn't recommend them enough! Their website allowed me to easily access deployments in both preview and production environments, sync environment variables between my local system and the server, and even <a href=""https://vercel.com/storage/postgres"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">manage my own PostgreSQL database</a>. Because I didn't have to worry about hosting, I could productively iterate on my website design and make much more progress than my previous attempts.</p><p>While I still used React components, I also used another Vercel technology in my website, <a href=""https://nextjs.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">NextJS</a>, a more robust framework that synergized with my production workflow. To make my website look nice, I used <a href=""https://tailwindcss.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">TailwindCSS</a>, a utility-class-based CSS framework, and <a href=""https://daisyui.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">DaisyUI</a>, a component framework that made my designs more consistent across web pages. I used <a href=""https://www.prisma.io/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Prisma</a> as an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ORM</a>, or object-relational mapping, which allowed me to query my SQL database using JavaScript code. To store images for my portfolio entries, I used <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">AWS S3</a>, a file hosting service, which gave me experience working with cloud servers.</p><p>The most important technology I used when making this website was <a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">TypeScript</a>, a superset of JavaScript that incorporates static typing features in a dynamically typed language. In short, TypeScript makes my code more readable, maintainable, and debuggable. While TypeScript is still an emerging technology, I hope to be able to use it in future web projects.</p><h1>Main Challenges</h1><p>The biggest challenge I faced when finishing this website was, well, finishing! Without a clear goal in mind, it's hard to know when to stop and create a finished project. I recognize that I tend to focus on extremely small features or aesthetic bugs that don't contribute to my main project rather than trying to get something that works as intended. By working on this project, especially over the final week, I learned how to meaningfully prioritize features within a project to boost my productivity.</p><p>I also faced some challenges stitching the back end and the front end through my APIs. NextJS combines support for front end and back end development through an API directory, but I also needed to ensure that my NextJS API endpoints, my SQL database, and my S3 files were all synchronized when a request was made. A lot of my time was spent just making sure that the images could be sent to the cloud at all! I struggled the most with this because I didn't have that much experience with the cloud, but after going over the documentation from Amazon and from Prisma, I was able to overcome these challenges and create a finished product.</p><h1>What I Learned</h1><p>More-so that programming knowledge, I think this whole website making experience taught me how I should organize my projects going forward. My previous attempts at making a website failed because I didn't think about web hosting until it became too late to easily add features or check for bugs. Before starting a new project, I now plan on formulating a prototype of my front end and back end using online tools such as <a href=""https://www.figma.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Figma</a> or even just drawing out flow charts of my APIs. All in all, I am happy that I was able to finish my website and learn so much during the process!</p>","A short article about my experience making this website","Making my Website"
"18","2023-09-20 18:31:41.474","2023-09-20 18:31:41.474","<p>I recently started an online internship at <a href=""https://einnel.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">EinNel Technologies</a>, a company in India which I had a connection to. So far, it has been a great learning experience, not only for expertise with certain programming tools, but also with working in an active team. I was assigned to the mobile development team, where we use Flutter to create our mobile apps.</p><p>I have had some previous experience Flutter, the mobile development framework, and Dart, the language Flutter uses. Funnily enough, it was also when I was working with a team in India! During my previous time working on a Flutter project, I didn't understand too much, and mostly helped around with maintaining our version control and selling our app to our church members.</p><p>Now, by working in a more professional capacity with Flutter, I've definitely learned a lot more. The hands-on experience working at EinNel has been a great boost to my career. But before I keep writing about my experience with Flutter, what even is it?</p><h2>What is Flutter and Dart?</h2><p><a href=""https://flutter.dev/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Flutter</a> is an open-source UI software development framework created by Google. It's designed to help developers build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter allows developers to create beautiful and highly customizable user interfaces with ease. It achieves this through a rich set of pre-designed widgets that can be easily customized to match the desired look and feel of your app. Flutter has gained popularity for its fast-growing community, extensive documentation, and robust ecosystem of packages, making it a versatile choice for building cross-platform mobile applications.</p><p><a href=""https://dart.dev/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Dart</a> is the programming language that powers Flutter. Developed by Google, Dart is a modern, object-oriented language known for its simplicity and efficiency. Dart's syntax is similar to Java or Kotlin, which are also used for mobile app development. Dart's concise syntax and strong type system make it relatively easy to learn and maintain, even for developers with varying levels of experience. It also boasts a well-structured package manager, [Pub](https://pub.dev/), which simplifies the process of adding third-party libraries to your Flutter project. With Dart as the foundation, Flutter provides a powerful and efficient environment for building cross-platform mobile apps, ensuring not only beautiful UIs but also excellent performance across different devices and platforms.</p><h2>What I worked on</h2><p>At EInNel, my first project was to re-create their attendance app using Flutter. My boss split up the work into smaller steps and gave each of them to me as daily or weekly tasks. For example, one day I would work on just the login page, then the next day just the profile page. At first the tasks were straightforward, introducing me to the variety of widgets that Flutter uses to manage the app's front-end UI. Eventually I started to work on connecting the front-end I had made to the back-end infrastructure that EInNel used. Working on this part of the project was much harder for me because I had to deal with several APIs, all with different specifications. Figuring out whether to use a POST or a GET request was unclear to me at first, and even if I could figure it out, debugging any issues I faced would take a very long time and leave me frustrated. Even though the difficulty of my assignment increased, I am still continuing to learn and grow through my experience.</p><h2>Personal Project</h2><p>While working on the front-end of the project at EinNel, I still wanted to learn more about the capabilities of Flutter. So, I decided to start on my own personal project that used Flutter. I wanted to create a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">pomodoro timer</a>, which I have been using since high school to keep me focused and productive. If I could successfully make this app, I could use&nbsp;it to manage my time better, and maybe even help other people too!</p><h3>Highs</h3><p>I started making the timer app by working on the front-end first, which was very fun. I discovered neumorphic design, which creates this 3d effect for buttons and other widgets. Although it has its issues with accessibility, I still wanted to try it out and see it in a real app. I also started to use Figma for app design, which was a tool I wasn't familiar with at first. I started to get the hang of it as I iterated upon my front-end design, and I hope to use it more extensively in my future projects.</p><h3>Lows</h3><p>Things started getting more difficult when adding the back-end. I guess that back-end is not my strong suit! Instead of API calls to an external server. The problem arose when testing my app on a physical device. When testing a Flutter app, I usually start with running my app on a phone simulator, such as the iOS simulator provided on Mac computers with Xcode. Programs run differently on the simulator, so you can't do any performance or UX testing through a simulator. When I was happy with the results on the simulator, I tried to run my app on my iPhone. I encountered a bug where the timer would stop if the app wasn't running in the foreground, but would instead pause. I did some research on the issue and found that making a timer app in Flutter requires making platform-specific changes, meaning that timers work differently on Android and iOS. Because of this roadblock, I started to give up on this project. Recently, however, I changed my goals for this project and am willing to try it again, just with some slightly different functionality. I also want to write a longer blog post just about this app <s>if</s> when I finish it.</p><h2>Wrap Up</h2><p>In general, I have had a very positive experience programming with Flutter. With support from my boss at EinNel, I am learning a lot about the framework through hands-on experience. Working on my personal project, the pomodoro timer, has also taught me not only more about Flutter, but also important concepts in mobile app development in general, such as testing, debugging, and specification.</p>","My experience working with Flutter in my internship and my personal projects.","My Experience with Flutter"
